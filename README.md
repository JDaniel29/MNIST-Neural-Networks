# MNIST Neural-Networks
This repository holds my attempts at learning how to make neural networks through Tensorflow to classify handwriting digits.

## Dataset Source
While this model uses the MNIST dataset, it was trained off of [this CSV version of the set from Kaggle.](https://www.kaggle.com/oddrationale/mnist-in-csv)
